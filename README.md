Leapot comapny hackthon 2025 Voice-Driven Property Listing Tool for Real Estate Agents &amp; Brokers

Problem Statement 1:
Voice-Driven Property Listing Tool for Real Estate Agents & Brokers
üìù Background:
In the real estate world, agents and brokers often receive property details from sellers via phone calls, followed by photos sent over WhatsApp or email. These conversations are typically oral, and agents are forced to remember or manually jot down key details, which often leads to errors or missed information.
üéØ Objective:
Design and develop a real-time voice-enabled web application that allows real estate agents and brokers to create accurate property listings using natural voice input from any device (laptop, tablet, or mobile phone). The application should simplify the process of adding property details to an MLS (Multiple Listing Service) system.

üîß Requirements:
Voice-Based Data Entry:


Provide a user-friendly interface where agents can speak the property details naturally.


Capture the speech and convert it to structured property data (e.g., type, location, price, area, etc.).


Smart Data Validation:


If any key details are missing (such as location, price, area in sq. ft., etc.), the app should prompt the agent to provide the missing information via voice.


Photo Integration:


After the voice input is complete, the app should ask the user whether property photos are available at a default local or cloud directory.


If available, the app should automatically retrieve and attach them to the listing.


Listing Creation:


Once all required details are collected, the app should compile the data into a structured listing format (suitable for uploading to an MLS system).


Display a preview of the listing for review.



üõ†Ô∏è Technical Constraints:
Tech Stack: You must use the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).


Speech-to-Text: Integrate browser-native speech recognition or use third-party APIs (e.g., Google Cloud Speech, Web Speech API).


Real-Time Flow: Ensure a seamless conversational experience without page reloads, using React and WebSocket/Event-based architecture.


Device Compatibility: The application must be responsive and work across mobile, tablet, and desktop.



üß† Bonus Points for:
Implementing natural language understanding (NLU) to improve voice input interpretation.


Adding multi-language support.


Providing auto-fill suggestions for frequently used terms (e.g., popular locations).


Exporting listings to a standard MLS-compatible format (e.g., JSON, XML, or CSV).



‚úÖ Deliverables:
A working web application with GitHub source code.


A brief demo video or presentation.


Clear documentation on setup, features, and API usage.
